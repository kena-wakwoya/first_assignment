# first_assignment
This repo is for firstassignment for software engineering II course.
The repo has two directory folders 
1) srs-sds ==> This folder has both the sds and srs file of our project
2) two app ==> This  folder has two application which  I made to show two different architecural pattern of software design.
The first application (androidstudentmanagementSystem)  is written by having the singleton architectural patten in mind which is used for when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. 
The second application (MVPloginS) is written as the model view presenter software design. This is  used: 
        1	when we want to maximize the amount of code that is tested with automation.
        2	When we want to separate the business logic from the user interface (ui)
My concern here is to  separate the logic of model , view and presenter from each other as required.

Generally this two app is done depending on how should i design my project when i want to do some thing. It concers how to organize my project for the future not what the app  i wrote know does!
